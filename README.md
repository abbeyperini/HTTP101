I keep my code public to help other people learn. If you build inspired by my code or tutorial, an acknowledgment in your README would be nice. To use my code exactly in your own project, personal or commercial, all you have to do is credit me in an acknowledgment in your README and visibly on the page that uses it on your site. For example: ```<div class="copyright">&copy; Untitled. All rights reserved. Includes code by: <a href="https://abbeyperini.dev">Abbey Perini</a>.</div>```
